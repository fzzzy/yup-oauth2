**yup-oauth2** is a utility library which implements several OAuth 2.0 flows. It's mainly used by
[google-apis-rs](https://github.com/Byron/google-apis-rs), to authenticate against Google services.
(However, you're able to use it with raw HTTP requests as well; the flows are implemented as token
sources yielding HTTP Bearer tokens).

### Supported authorization types

* Device flow (user enters code on authorization page)
* Installed application flow (user visits URL, copies code to application, application uses
  code to obtain token). Used for services like GMail, Drive, ...
* Service account flow: Non-interactive for server-to-server communication based on public key
  cryptography. Used for services like Cloud Pubsub, Cloud Storage, ...

### Usage

Please have a look at the [API landing page][API-docs] for all the examples you will ever need.

A simple commandline program which authenticates any scope and prints token information can be found
in [the examples directory][examples].

The video below shows the *auth* example in action. It's meant to be used as utility to record all
server communication and improve protocol compliance.
